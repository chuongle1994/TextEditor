# Text Editor in C++

This is a simple text editor implemented in C++ using linked lists and stacks. The text editor allows basic text editing operations such as inserting text, deleting text, undoing changes, saving to a file, loading from a file, searching and replacing text, and displaying text statistics.

- **Undo**: You can undo the last operation using option 3.

- **Display Text**: Option 4 displays the current content of the text editor.

- **Save to File**: You can save the text to a file (or choose a filename) using option 5.

- **Load from File**: Option 6 allows you to load text from an existing file.

- **Search and Replace**: Use option 7 to search for a specific term and replace it with another term.

- **Print Statistics**: Option 8 displays statistics about the text, including word count, character count, line count, and paragraph count.
